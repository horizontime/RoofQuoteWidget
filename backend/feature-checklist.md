## Implementation Summary

### âœ… Completed (Phases 1-8)
- **Backend API**: Fully functional FastAPI backend with all core features
- **Database**: SQLite3 with SQLAlchemy ORM, auto-seeded with mock data
- **No Authentication**: As requested, no auth layer implemented
- **Mock Integrations**: Google Maps, CRM, and measurement APIs return placeholder data
- **PDF Generation**: Working PDF proposals with contractor branding
- **Analytics**: Comprehensive tracking and reporting endpoints

### ðŸ“‹ Remaining Tasks (Optional)
- Unit and integration tests
- Performance testing
- Rate limiting
- Database migrations
- Backup/restore functionality

## Notes
- All data will be stored in SQLite3 database (no hardcoded mock data in code)
- No authentication required for MVP
- Seed file will populate initial mock data for development/testing
- API documentation available at `/docs` when server is running
