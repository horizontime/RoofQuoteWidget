The Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for this project is an "Instant Roof Quote Widget" with a corresponding "Admin Console".

Here's a breakdown of what needs to be delivered for the MVP:

For the Contractor (Admin Console):

- Product Configuration: The contractor must be able to:
	- Choose from three tiers of shingle types (SKUs).
	- Set the price per square foot for each of these shingle tiers.
- Branding Customization: The contractor needs to be able to upload their logo and choose their brand colors.
- Proposal Template Setup: The contractor should be able to configure the template for the PDF proposal that will be generated.
- Widget Embedding Code: The admin console must be able to generate a simple code snippet (like an iframe or script tag) that the contractor can copy and paste into their website to display the quote widget.


For the Homeowner (Widget):

- Address Input: The homeowner can enter their address into the widget.
- Map Confirmation: The widget will display a map for the homeowner to confirm their property location.
- Estimate Display: Based on the input, the widget will show an instant estimate for the "good," "better," and "best" shingle options.
- Responsive Design: The widget needs to look good and function well on different devices, and ideally, it should automatically match the style of the contractor's website or be configurable to do so.
In essence, the MVP focuses on creating a functional tool that allows contractors to provide instant roof quotes on their website, engaging potential customers early in their buying journey.
